*cQLogo* is a compiler for the UCBLogo language written in C++ using Qt and LLVM. It is a fork of the QLogo project, which is an interpreter for the UCBLogo language.

*Psychi* is the graphical user interface for cQLogo. Psychi provides a command line, a simple text editor, and a turtle graphics window.

cQLogo is _incomplete_. For an *actual working* UCBLogo interpreter see either:

https://github.com/jasonsikes/QLogo

or

https://github.com/jrincayc/ucblogo-code

At this time I am developing cQLogo on Linux (Fedora 41 on ARM64).

I am no longer testing on MS Windows as I no longer have nor use a Windows computer. I haven't been able to build on MacOS using LLVM provided by Homebrew. (I'm not saying it's not possible; I just decided to focus on development instead.)

The following table contains all the commands in UCBLogo. The commands that are incomplete are marked by *"TODO"*.

Table summary: GRAPHICS is complete. ARITHMETIC is complete. CONTROL STRUCTURES is almost complete.

* README for the original QLogo interpreter.

/QLogo is an interpreter for the UCBLogo language. What follows is the README for that interpreter. You should be aware that LOTS of functionality is not yet implemented in cQLogo./

It mimics the UCBLogo interpreter developed by Brian Harvey at U.C. Berkeley.

You can find the UCBLogo Manual here:

http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/usermanual

The differences between cQLogo and UCBLogo are described in the *nuances* section below. There aren't many.

** Compiling

*** Note:

There have been *significant* changes to cQLogo since I last tried building on MacOS or Windows. The instructions provided below were known to work *before* QLogo became cQLogo, before I started using LLVM. I doubt they will work now.

Building cQLogo requires LLVM, Qt6.5, and CMake.

*** To build in MacOS and Windows:

Simply open the ~CMakeLists.txt~ file in QtCreator and build within there. 

*** To build in Linux:

If you have qtcreator, you can use qtcreator in Linux in the same manner as in Windows and MacOS described above.

Otherwise, you can follow the standard CMake build procedure. First, create a build directory somewhere. I place the build directory inside the cQLogo source directory.

Then have CMake create the build structure.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd cQLogo
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
#+END_SRC

Then enter into your build directory and issue ~make~, and, optionally, if all goes well you can run ~make install~

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd build
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

This will give you two executables and supporting files:

1. ~qlogo~: this is the Logo compiler that can be run from the command line.

2. ~Psychi~: this is the graphical user interface that will run qlogo and provides the turtle and editor.

3. ~qlogo_library.db~: this is the SQLite database that stores the standard library.

4. ~qlogo_help.db~: this is the SQLite database that stores the help texts.


** Here are the nuances (very minor):


*** Colors can be specified in one of five ways (instead of two):

   1. as a palette index (0 to 100), same as UCBLogo

   2. as a list of *three* numbers, one for each of red, green, blue ~[0 0 0]~ is black, ~[100 100 100]~ is white, also same as UCBLogo.
   
   3. as a list of *four* numbers, similar to Option 2 above, with the fourth value being transparency (or "alpha"). ~100~ is fully opaque, and ~0~ means fully transparent.

   4. as a named color from the X Color Database, e.g. ~white~ or ~lemonchiffon~. The list of color names can be retrieved using the ~ALLCOLORS~ command or from the X Color database found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names
   
   5. as a hex RGB triplet, preceded by "#", and followed by 3, 6, 9, or 12 hexadecimal digits. For example, each of the following produces the color red: ~#f00~, ~#ff0000~, ~#fff000000~, and ~#ffff00000000~.


*** Changes in font properties (size, color, family) do not affect characters already printed.

This enables multiple colors and fonts on the same console.
  
*** cQLogo does not look for nor automatically load ~STARTUP.LG~.

*** ~COMMANDLINE~ contains **ALL** of the parameters used to start qlogo instead of just the ones that appear after a hyphen.

*** If ~ERRACT~ is set and its size is greater than zero, then any errors execute ~PAUSE~.
  
*** Garbage collection is on-the-fly.

Memory is freed the moment a word/list/array is no longer needed. ~GC~ and ~.SETSEGMENTSIZE~ are provided for compaitibility, but are no-ops.

*** No scunching.

UCBLogo provided a scrunch to compensate for older CRT screens with non-square pixels. This enabled turtle operations to maintain consistent physical height-width. The drawback is that some orientation queries are inaccurate. ~SCRUNCH~ and ~SETSCRUNCH~ are no-ops.

*** ~SAVEPICT~ saves a copy of the canvas in the format given by the filename's extension.

For example: ~SAVEPICT "MY_PICTURE.PNG~ will save in PNG format.

cQLogo can save an image in the following formats: BMP, JPG/JPEG, PNG, PPM, XBM, and XPM

*** ~WINDOW~ no longer simply allows the turtle to run away from the canvas.

~WINDOW~ now grows the canvas to accommodate the turtle's position.

*** There is no facility yet for translation/internationalization.

All the strings used in cQLogo source code can be translated, but no translations have been made.

*** The following commands are not implemented:

**** ~SETMARGINS~:

The original purpose of the command was to enable text to be visible on projectors which cut off outer boundaries of a computer screen. Projectors and monitors produced in recent years show all of the computer screen. In addition, cQLogo is a windowed application so an instructor or presentor can move the window to a different position.

**** ~FILL~:

One of the user interface principles for cQLogo is that the canvas should be device resolution-independent. When the cQLogo window is resized or the separator between the text and the graphics is moved then the graphics will be redrawn with the new dimensions.

The Flood Fill algorithm depends on specific pixels which means that what is filled can change dramatically depending on the size of the canvas.

The other reason is that the Flood Fill algorithm can slow down window resizing. ~FILL~ is still available.

**** ~EPSPICT~:

This is replaced by ~SVGPICT~. See below.

**** ~CSLSLOAD~:

Not implemented yet.

**** ~SETCSLSLOC~:

Not implemented yet.

**** ~SETEDITOR~:

Psychi has its own built-in editor. If you run the qlogo program from a command line, such as in a terminal, no editor is available.

**** ~SETLIBLOC~:

Not implemented. cQLogo uses a SQLite database to store its standard library. You can use the ~setlibloc~ command line parameter to tell qlogo where to find the SQLite database if it is in a different location than where qlogo expects it.

**** ~SETHELPLOC~:

Not implemented. cQLogo uses a SQLite database to store its help text. You can use the ~sethelploc~ command line parameter to tell qlogo where to find the SQLite database if it is in a different location than where qlogo expects it.

**** ~SETTEMPLOC~:

cQLogo doesn't create temporary files.

**** ~NOREFRESH~ and ~REFRESH~:

cQLogo is designed from the ground up to have a very responsive user interface. The canvas will always redraw itself whenever the window is resized.

**** ~SETPENPATTERN~ and ~PENPATTERN~:

This isn't implemented yet because I haven't yet decided what kinds of patterns are wanted or useful.


*** The following variables have no special meaning:

**** ~REDEFP~:

Qt has strong support for internationalization, but in cQLogo it is only partially implemented. Internationalization will be supported soon.

**** ~USEALTERNATENAMES~:

Qt has strong support for internationalization, but in cQLogo it is only partially implemented. Internationalization will be supported soon.


*** The following commands are NEW:

**** ~SVGPICT~ has been added and is a replacement for ~EPSPICT~.

~SVGPICT~ will save the image on the canvas in Scalable Vector Graphics format.

**** ~ALLFONTS~:

Returns a list of all the fonts available on your system.

**** ~ALLCOLORS~:

Returns a list of all the named colors that cQLogo knows about.

**** ~TIME~:

This is mostly for my own curiosity and for debugging. ~TIME~ will take one parameter, a list, which it will execute. A timer will start when the list is executed and then stop when the list is finished. The total running time of the list will be printed. The output will be whatever the list outputs, if anything.

**** ~MARK~:

This is for debugging memory management. ~MARK~ will take one parameter, set a flag on it, and output that parameter. At the moment it is marked, a debugging message will be printed out. Later, if/when the item is deleted, another debugging message will be printed.

**** ~CURSORINSERT~:

Sets cursor to insert mode in QLogo. This is the default.

**** ~CURSOROVERWRITE~:

Sets cursor to overwrite mode in QLogo.

**** ~CURSORMODE~:

Outputs either ~INSERT~ or ~OVERWRITE~.

**** ~STANDOUT~:

This works in the cQLogo GUI by switching the font's foreground and background colors. It isn't implemented for text terminals.

**** ~SETBOUNDS~:

The drawing canvas in Psychi is designed to be resolution independent. The user can stretch and resize the GUI window and its components without needing interaction or permission from the cQLogo program. Therefore, the best way for the programmer to have control and the GUI to have responsiveness is to set the bounds programatically. The GUI then can squeeze or stretch the canvas to fit the window as needed.

The coordinate system of the drawing canvas is Cartesian: the Origin ~[0,0]~ is always in the center. The range of the X-coordinate is between ~-boundX~ and ~boundX~. The range of the Y-coordinate is between ~-boundY~ and ~boundY~. For example, a bound set at ~[350 150]~ means that the turtle is visible if its X-coordinate is between -350 and 350 and its Y-coordinate is between -150 and 150. See also ~BOUNDS~.

**** ~BOUNDS~:

Outputs a list of two numbers giving the maximum bounds (x,y) of the canvas.

**** ~FILEDIALOG~:

Provides the user with a file dialog to select a file. The file path is returned as a string.

*** The following commands are slightly different:

**** ~LPUT~ and ~FPUT~:

When using the Word form of ~LPUT~ and ~FPUT~, there is no single-character limitation. I'm not sure why that limitation is necessary in UCBLogo.
